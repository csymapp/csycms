This guide assumes that you've set up a VPS and installed a LAMP or LEMP stack, Git, Composer, and Node.js.  If you're insistent on using shared hosting, this guide won't work for you - you'll have to copy your files over FTP instead.

The first step is to [install and configure required software on the remote server](/going-live/vps-production-environment/server-setup).
