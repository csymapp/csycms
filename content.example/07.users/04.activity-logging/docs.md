By default, user activities are logged to the `activities` database table.  Logged information includes the activity time and an activity type, the `user_id`, the user's IP address, and a description of the activity.  The administrative interface provides convenient tables for viewing these logs:

## Default activity types

The following activity types are logged by the core UserFrosting features:

| Activity Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `sign_up` | The user signed up via the public registration page. |
| `sign_in` | The user signed in to their account. |
| `update_profile_settings` | The user updated their profile settings (name, locale, etc). |
| `update_account_settings` | The user updated their account settings (email or password). |
| `sign_out` | The user explicitly signed out of their account (note, this does not capture when a user's session expires on its own). |
| `group_create` | The user created a new group. |
| `group_delete` | The user deleted a group. |
| `group_update_info` | The user updated information for a group. |
| `role_create` | The user created a new role. |
| `role_delete` | The user deleted a role. |
| `role_update_info` | The user updated general information for a role. |
| `role_update_field` | The user updated a specific attribute of a role (this includes modifying the permissions for a role). |
| `account_create` | The user created an account for another user. |
| `account_delete` | The user deleted another user's account. |
| `account_update_info` | The user updated general account info (name, locale, etc) for another user. |
| `account_update_field` | The user updated a specific field for another user (this includes modifying a user's roles or password, and enabling/disabling their account). |

>>> These activities are only logged _when successful_.  If a user is unable to perform one of these activities, for example because they don't have the necessary permissions or there is some other problem, the attempt won't be logged.

## Logging activities

In your controller methods, simply call the `info` method on the `userActivityLogger` service to log additional activities:

```php
// Create activity record
$this->ci->userActivityLogger->info("User {$currentUser->user_name} adopted a new owl '{$owl->name}'.", [
    'type' => 'adopt_owl'
]);
```

The first parameter is the activity description.  The second parameter contains an array, which should have a `type` key defined.  The value of this key decides the activity type that will be logged.  Note that these activity types are not defined anywhere explicitly - they are stored in the database as plain text and you may create new types on the fly when you log an activity.

>>>>> In general, you will probably want to log user activities at the end of the controller method, after the user's activity has completed successfully.  However, you may choose to write to this log at any point in your code.

## Retrieving activities for a user

The `activities` relation on the `User` model returns a collection of all activities for a user:

```php
$activities = $user->activities;
```

The `User` model also provides a number of helper methods for user activities.

### Getting a user's last activity

The `id` of a user's last activity is 'cached' in the `users` table under the `last_activity_id` column.  This makes it more efficient to retrieve the user's last activity.

You can get the `Activity` record for a user's last activity using the `lastActivity` relation:

```php
$lastActivity = $user->lastActivity;
```

>>> Notice that we reference this as an model _property_, rather than calling it as a method.  If we called `$user->lastActivity()` (with parentheses) instead, it would return the _relationship_ rather than the model itself.

### Getting a user's last activity by type

If you want to get the last activity _of a specific type_, use the `lastActivityOfType` method:

```php
$lastSignIn = $user->lastActivityOfType('sign_in')->get();
```

Since `lastActivityOfType` returns a `Builder` object, we need to call `get` to return the actual result.

### Getting the time of a user's last activity

If we only want the timestamp of a user's last activity, we can can call `lastActivityTime`:

```php
$lastSignInTime = $user->lastActivityTime('sign_in');
```

### Getting the time _since_ a user's last activity

The `getSecondsSinceLastActivity` method returns the number of seconds since the last time a user performed a particular activity:

```php
$elapsedTime = $user->getSecondsSinceLastActivity('walked_dog');
```

### Joining a user's last activity on a query

If you are querying the `users` table using the Eloquent query builder, you can join each user's last activity from the `activities` table:

```php
$usersWithActivities = User::joinLastActivity()->get();
```

## Logging to other handlers

By default, UserFrosting implements a [custom Monolog handler](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/master/doc/04-extending.md),  `UserFrosting\Sprinkles\Account\Log\UserActivityDatabaseHandler`, that sends user activity logs to the `activities` database table.

This is all assembled in the `userActivityLogger` service.  If you'd prefer, you can [extend or override](/services/extending-services) the `userActivityLogger` service to add additional handlers, or even completely replace the custom handler altogether.

```php
$container->extend('userActivityLogger', function ($logger, $c) {
    $logFile = $c->get('locator')->findResource('log://activities.log', true, true);

    $handler = new StreamHandler($logFile);

    $logger->pushHandler($handler);

    return $logger;
};
```

In either case you should always retain the custom `UserActivityProcessor`, which assembles the information to be logged such as the `user_id` and the user's IP address.

See the [Monolog documentation](https://seldaek.github.io/monolog/) for more details.
