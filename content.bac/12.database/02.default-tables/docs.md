When you install UserFrosting with the [Bakery CLI](/cli), a number of tables will automatically added to your database.  These tables are required for UserFrosting's built-in features, such as user accounts, request throttling, persistent sessions, and access control.

The [migrations](/database/migrations) for most tables can be found in the `src/Database/Migrations` directory of the Sprinkle that depends on it.  The exceptions are the system tables, which are located in `app/system/Database/Migrations`.
