# Going Live

The general process of "going live" with your project, and making it accessible to your users (or the public), is known as **putting your application into production**.  The place where your application lives and runs is known as the **production environment**.

The specific act of transferring your code from the development environment to the production environment is known as **deployment.**  The processes and roles surrounding the deployment process is referred to as [**DevOps**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps).

This chapter discusses some options for **where** to deploy your UserFrosting application (hosting), **how** to deploy, and what additional steps you should take to ensure **security**, **reliability**, and a **good experience** for your users.
