We now have a complete, though very basic page to display a table of data dynamically powered by the database.  But, there is a lot more we can still do to improve this page! Continue exploring the documentation to learn how to add more features to your pastry page:

- [Use a Sprunje to paginate the results](/database/data-sprunjing)
- [use ufForm to set up an interface for creating, editing and deleting entries](/client-side-code/components/forms)
- [Create automated tests for your code](/advanced/automated-tests)
- [Create a custom Bakery command](/cli/custom-commands)
