It is essential to understand some basic security concepts before diving into web development.

Most of what we discuss in this section is covered in OWASP's [Top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project) list; nonetheless we paraphrase it here and discuss the strategies and features that UserFrosting offers to mitigate many of these vulnerabilities.
